# 🔄 TEAM RETROSPECTIVE - Epic 1: Telegram Telegram Support

**EPIC 1 SUMMARY:**

Delivery Metrics:
- Completed: 9/9 stories (100%)
- Average velocity: Fast delivery, less than a week for the entire epic.

Quality and Technical:
- Blockers encountered: Environment dependency confusion leading to failures locating system binaries (`node`) or unexpected behavior (`execution_log` rigidity).

**Key Insights:**
- Fast progression! We maintained excellent momentum.
- Environment differences (WSL vs Windows CMD vs mobile cloud) created significant friction. We need clear documentation of dependencies to mitigate this.
- Some tools/scripts assume rigid environment constraints that aren’t always true (like `execution_log` needing `logs/` directory prep or hardcoded `bash` vs `cmd`).

**📝 EPIC 1 ACTION ITEMS:**

**Technical Debt & Environment Alignment:**
1. Document Supported Development Environments & System Requirements
   Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
   Deadline: Before Epic 2 starts
   Success criteria: A clear `docs/development_environment.md` (or similar) exists detailing exact versions and setups for WSL/Windows/Cloud.

2. Review & Refactor System Binaries Dependencies
   Owner: Elena (Junior Dev)
   Priority: High
   Estimated effort: 1 sprint
   Success criteria: Codebase audited for required system binaries (like `node`, `python`, etc.). Implemented graceful fallbacks or clear error messages when absent.

3. Investigate `execution_log` Rigidity
   Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
   Priority: Medium
   Success criteria: `execution_log` is reviewed and refactored to be more robust across different environments.

**🚀 EPIC 2 PREPARATION TASKS:**

- [ ] Complete the Action Items above before starting Epic 2 stories to prevent environment issues reproducing.
- [ ] Review Epic 2 Epics doc and story specs.

**Readiness Assessment:**
- Epic 1 Stories are 100% complete.
- We have 3 critical Action Items identified to stabilize the environment across devices.
