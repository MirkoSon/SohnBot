# 🔄 TEAM RETROSPECTIVE - Epic 2: Git Operations & Version Control

**EPIC 2 SUMMARY:**

Delivery Metrics:
- Completed: 4/4 stories (100%)
- Average velocity: Extremely fast delivery. Two epics completed in a single day.

Quality and Technical:
- Blockers encountered: No major blockers.
- Security considerations: Addressed option injection risks by using `--` separator for branch switching and enforcing strict regex validation for branch names.

**Key Insights:**
- Excellent Momentum: The team velocity is exceptionally high, delivering two complete epics in one day while maintaining high quality in tests and error handling.
- Security First: Catching option injection and invalid branch name edge cases during code review proved the value of adversarial thinking.
- Environment Preparedness: The team feels confident about the graceful error handling implemented in Epic 2, though the true test will occur in Epic 3 when tested via mobility (cloud/phone).

**📝 EPIC 2 ACTION ITEMS:**

**Process Improvements:**
1. Monitor Mobile/Cloud Execution
   Owner: {user_name} / Charlie (Senior Dev)
   Deadline: During Epic 3 execution
   Success criteria: Monitor how the Git operations (and `execution_log`) behave when executed from a mobile/cloud environment. Verify the graceful fallbacks work as expected.

**🚀 EPIC 3 PREPARATION TASKS:**

**Knowledge Development:**
- [ ] Review Epic 3 Epics doc (System Observability & Monitoring).
- [ ] Ensure all local development environments (PC, Cloud) are ready for testing HTTP-based observability and health checks.

**Readiness Assessment:**
- Epic 2 Stories are 100% complete.
- Codebase is stable with comprehensive error handling for git operations.
- We are ready to begin Epic 3.
